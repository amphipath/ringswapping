      <p>
        In MapleStory, changing equipment is restricted when direct attacking
        skills are used. Attempting to do so produces an error message in the
        middle of the screen.
      </p>
      <img src="/errorbox.png" />
      <p>
        However, in MapleSEA exclusively, there are many non-direct attacking
        skills that disable equipment changing, even though they should not. The
        reason why they shouldn't is because in Korea MapleStory (KMS), the base
        game, these skills do not disable equipment changing. In MapleSEA, this
        erroneous behaviour manifests as a chatbox message alerting us that we
        cannot change equips for 5 seconds after these skills do damage. This
        message <span style="font-weight: bold">does not exist</span> in KMS
        because this behaviour does not exist in KMS, and should be fixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following is a compiled list of evidence of these malfunctioning
        skills in MSEA, and their correct expected behaviour in KMS.
