      <p>In MapleStory, changing equipment is restricted when direct attacking skills are used. Attempting to do so produces an error message in the middle of the screen.</p>
      <img src="/errorbox.png"/>
      <p>However, in MapleSEA exclusively, there are many non-direct attacking skills that disable equipment changing, even though they should not.
        The reason why they shouldn't is because in Korea MapleStory (KMS), the base game, these skills do not disable equipment changing.
        In MapleSEA, this erroneous behaviour manifests as a chatbox message alerting us that we cannot change equips for 5 seconds after these skills do damage.
        This message <span style="font-weight:bold">does not exist</span> in KMS because this behaviour does not exist in KMS, and should be fixed.
      </p>
      <img src="/chatmessage.png" />
      <p>The following is a compiled list of evidence of these malfunctioning skills in MSEA, and their correct expected behaviour in KMS.</p>
